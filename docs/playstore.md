## Publishing process (after identity verified)

1. (manual) Setup → API access → Link `opencode-mobile-deploy`. Grant `playstore-deploy@…` "Release to production, exclude devices, and use Play App Signing".
2. (manual) Create app `ai.opencode.mobile`. Fill listing from `distribution/play-listing.md`.
3. (manual) Upload graphic assets + privacy policy URL.
4. (manual) Complete Data safety + Content rating + App access forms.
5. (manual, first time only) Upload `app-release.aab` to Internal testing track → add tester emails → publish.
6. (automated thereafter) `git tag v0.2.x && git push --tags` → CI builds + publishes to Internal.

After 14 days on Closed testing with 12+ active testers → promote to Production.

## Sibling channels: F-Droid + IzzyOnDroid

OpenCode Mobile is also distributed via F-Droid (mainline) and IzzyOnDroid —
the two primary OSS Android app stores for privacy-conscious users.

All three channels use the **same signing key and same package id** (`ai.opencode.mobile`),
so users can update in-place across stores.

Submission packets (ready to file after the first Play release is live):

- `distribution/fdroid-submission/` — F-Droid mainline MR packet
  - `metadata.yml` — ready-to-PR fdroiddata metadata
  - `SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` — step-by-step MR filing guide
  - `REPRODUCIBLE-BUILD-NOTES.md` — reproducibility audit + fixes needed
  - `SIZE-OPTIMIZATION.md` — APK ABI splits + FCM flavor documentation
- `distribution/izzyondroid-submission/` — IzzyOnDroid inclusion request packet
  - `INCLUSION-REQUEST.md` — ready-to-paste Codeberg issue body
  - `SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` — step-by-step filing guide
- `distribution/SIGNING-KEY-FINGERPRINTS.md` — signing key SHA-256 fingerprints
- `docs/fdroid.md` — operational doc for F-Droid / IzzyOnDroid (mirrors this doc)

Timeline: IzzyOnDroid 1–3 days after first APK on GitHub releases.
F-Droid mainline 4–12 weeks after MR filed.
