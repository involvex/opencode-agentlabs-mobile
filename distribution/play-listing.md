### Full description (max 4000 chars)

```
OpenCode Mobile is the AI coding agent companion for developers who self-host opencode. Connect your Android phone to your opencode server and run AI-powered coding sessions from anywhere — review file diffs, approve tool calls, and guide Claude, GPT, or Gemini in real time.

<b>WHAT IT DOES</b>
OpenCode Mobile is a thin client for the opencode CLI (github.com/sst/opencode). It speaks the opencode HTTP + SSE API so every AI coding session running on your workstation or server is accessible from your phone. All AI model calls go through your own server — your API keys, your code, your infrastructure.

<b>KEY FEATURES</b>
• Real-time streaming chat — watch your AI coding agent think and respond token by token
• File diff viewer — see every code change the agent proposes before you approve it
• Tool call approval — review and approve file writes, shell commands, and other actions
• Multi-session management — start, resume, and switch between coding sessions
• Multiple connection types — local Wi-Fi, Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, Tailscale, or opencode Cloud (coming soon)
• Biometric unlock — fingerprint / Face ID keeps your sessions private

<b>WHO IT'S FOR</b>
• Developers running opencode on their workstation who want to check in from their phone
• Engineers away from their desk who want to review or guide long-running AI coding jobs
• Teams who self-host AI developer tools and want a polished mobile interface
• Open-source contributors who want a free, MIT-licensed alternative to proprietary AI coding apps

<b>WHAT IT IS NOT</b>
• Not a standalone AI model — you bring your own opencode server (which connects to Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, or local LLMs via your API keys)
• Not a code editor — it pairs with your existing IDE and terminal workflow
• Not a subscription app — free, open-source, MIT licensed, no ads, no telemetry you did not opt into

<b>SELF-HOSTED AI CODING</b>
Install opencode on any machine: npm install -g opencode-ai, then run opencode serve. Enter the server URL in the app. That's it — your AI coding agent is now on your phone.

<b>OPEN SOURCE</b>
OpenCode Mobile is MIT licensed. Source code, issue tracker, and community discussion at github.com/dzianisv/opencode-mobile. Contributions welcome.

<b>PRIVACY</b>
OpenCode Mobile does not collect your code, prompts, or AI responses. All traffic goes directly from the app to YOUR opencode server — never through our infrastructure. We use Sentry for crash diagnostics only (no PII, no message content, opt-in available).

Support: support@vibebrowser.app

## Keywords (not a Play Console field — guides copy and ASO)

### Primary keywords (title + short desc + first 3 lines of description)

| Keyword | Priority |
|---|---|
| `AI coding agent` | High |
| `coding assistant` | High |
| `opencode` | High |
| `developer tools` | Medium |
| `self-hosted AI` | High |

### Secondary keywords (weave into description body)

| Keyword | Rationale |
|---|---|
| `AI code review` | Maps to the diff viewer feature |
| `remote development` | Captures devs working off-device |
| `LLM client` | Early-adopter / technically precise audience |
| `Claude mobile` | Brand-transfer from Anthropic Claude users |
| `GPT coding` | Brand-transfer from OpenAI users |
| `coding on phone` | Low-competition long-tail |
| `AI terminal` | CLI-oriented devs |
| `Tailscale` / `Cloudflare Tunnel` | Appears naturally in description; captures tunnel-search users |

### Keywords to avoid

| Keyword | Reason |
|---|---|
| `Copilot`, `Cursor` | Competitor brand names — policy violation |
| `#1 AI coding app` | Superlative claims prohibited by Play policy |
| `free AI` | "Free" in title/short desc is prohibited; fine in body |
| `ChatGPT` | OpenAI brand — avoid unless describing a supported model |

## Categorization

| Field | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|

## Content rating

Run the IARC questionnaire on Play Console. Expected outcome based on app content:

| Region | Expected rating |
|---|---|
| ESRB (US) | Everyone |
| PEGI (EU) | 3 |
| USK (Germany) | 0 |
| Australia | G |

Questionnaire answers (all "No" — no violence / sexual / drugs / gambling content; app is a dev tool):
- Does it contain violence? No
- Does it contain sexual content? No
- Does it contain crude humor? No
- Does it use drugs/alcohol/tobacco? No
- Does it contain gambling? No
- Does it share user location? No
- Does it share user-generated content? No (private user → user-self only)
- Does it allow users to interact / chat? Yes (with their OWN backend, not other users)

If "interact with other users" is asked: answer NO — the chat is between the user and their own AI agent, not user-to-user.

## Target audience and content

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Target age group | 18+ (developer tool) |
| Appeals to children? | No |
| Ads? | No |
| In-app purchases? | (TBD — see monetization decision) |

---

## App access

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| All functionality available without restrictions? | No — requires user to provide their own opencode server URL |
| Provide test credentials? | Yes — provide Google reviewer with a temporary opencode server URL or instructions to spin one up |

Reviewer instructions (paste in App Access form):

```
OpenCode Mobile requires the user to bring their own opencode server (https://opencode.ai). To review the app:

1. Install opencode on any machine: `npm install -g opencode-ai`
2. Run `opencode serve` — prints a local URL like http://localhost:4096
3. In the app, tap "Connect" → enter the URL → connect.
4. Start a session, type a prompt, observe streaming response.

If reviewers cannot self-host, contact support@vibebrowser.app and we will provide a temporary hosted opencode endpoint for review.
```

## Release notes / "What's new" per release

Wired in CI: `distribution/whatsnew/whatsnew-en-US`.

Bump this file before tagging a release. Keep it under 500 chars. Per-language variants supported (`whatsnew-fr-FR`, `whatsnew-de-DE`, etc.).

---

## First release strategy

1. **Internal testing** track first (up to 100 testers, no review) — what CI is wired for.
2. **Closed testing** — 14+ days, 12+ testers required for new org accounts before promoting to production (Google's 2023 policy).
3. **Open testing** — optional intermediate step.
4. **Production** — only after Closed testing requirements met.

CI currently publishes to `internal` track. ✅
